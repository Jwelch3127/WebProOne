<!--Description-->
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>There are many types of breathing techniques, however, one of the most common for stress relief is, Diaphragmatic breathing. This type of breathing is also known as belly breathing or deep breathing, and is a breathing technique that involves the contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm muscle to promote deep and efficient breathing. The diaphragm muscle is located at the base of the lungs and is responsible for controlling breathing. During diaphragmatic breathing, the diaphragm muscle contracts and moves downward, allowing the lungs to expand and fill with air.</p> 

<p>This type of breathing is often used in relaxation exercises and is believed to help reduce stress, anxiety, and muscle tension. It is also used in various forms of meditation and mindfulness practices.</p>
