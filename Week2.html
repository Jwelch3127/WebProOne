    <p style="color #82C3EC;">Hi! My name is James, and I am currently in the Learning Design and Technology masters program at USF. I have a bachelorâ€™s in psychology from Stetson University (2016) and a Masters in College Student Affairs from Nova Southeastern University (2018). Currently, I work at USF as a course coordinator for the psychology department and my goal would be to eventually become a learning designer. I live in Zephyrhills with my wife (of 5 years) and three dogs: Jack Russell Terrier-mix, Lab-mix, and Siberian Husky. When I am not in classes or working, I enjoy playing the guitar, painting, and sketching, going to the beach, and watching horror movies. I enjoy keeping busy and learning as much as I can about a variety of different subjects.</p>
